                        Dilip Kumar was born as <strong> Mohammad Yusuf Khan</strong> on
                        11 December 1922, into a Hindko-speaking Hindkowan Awan Muslim
                        family at his family home in the Qissa Khawani Bazaar
                        neighbourhood of Peshawar, a city in the North-West Frontier
                        Province of British India. He was one of the twelve children of
                        Lala Ghulam Sarwar Khan and his wife Ayesha Begum. His father was
                        a fruit merchant. Khan was schooled at the Barnes School in
                        Deolali (now in Maharashtra), where his father owned orchards. He
                        grew up in the same neighbourhood in Peshawar as Raj Kapoor, his
                        childhood friend, and later his colleague in the film industry. In
                        1940, he moved to Pune and set up a dry fruit supply shop and a
                        canteen. Despite hailing from Peshawar, Khan's family decided
                        to remain in Bombay following the partition of the India in 1947.
                        Khan never acted under his birth name, debuting in Jwar Bhata in
                        1944 under the stage name Dilip Kumar. In his autobiography, Dilip
                        Kumar: The Substance and the Shadow, he wrote that the name was a
                        suggestion from Devika Rani, who was one of the producers on Jwar
                        Bhata.In an interview in 1970, he said that he adopted this name
                        out of fear of his father, who never approved of his acting career
                        because of the general poor image of cinema back then.

                        In 1940, when he was only 18 years old, he fled to Poona (Modern day, Pune, Maharashtra) after an argument with his father. On the merit of good English speaking and writing skills, he managed to get a job.He set up a sandwich stall at Army Club in Pune. when the contract ended, he shifted to Mumbai with the saving of ₹5000. In 1942, he met Dr. Masani who took him to Bombay Talkies in Malad where he met actress Devika Rani, owner of Bombay Talkies. Devika Rani asked him to sign up with Bombay Talkies with the salary of ₹1250/month. It was Devika Rani who requested him to change his name to Dilip Kumar.

                        In 1960, he portrayed the role of ‘Prince Salim‘ in K. Asif’s high-budget historical film, Mughal-e-Azam which was the highest grossing film in the Indian Cinema for the next 11 years until it was surpassed by film Haathi Mere Saathi (1971) and later by the film Sholay (1975).
                        
                        In 1991, he did Saudagar, alongside fellow veteran actor Raaj Kumar. This film was his last box-office success.
                  
                        In 1998, he worked on his last film, Qila which was a flop at the box office.
