              Kalam,
              <b>
                (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015,
                Shillong)</b
              >, Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in
              the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs.
              He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree
              in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of
              Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development
              Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research
              Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the
              first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced
              in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that
              produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him
              the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni,
              India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
              incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.

              From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense
              minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser
              (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.
              His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
              solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a
              national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the
              international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide
              plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road
              map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed
              society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures,
              increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a
              vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care
              and education.

              In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put
              forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman
              Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva)
              NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal
              were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National
              Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the
              election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely
              ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his
              term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s
              first woman president.Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam
              remained committed to using science and technology to transform
              India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several
              universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a
              lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was
              pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.Kalam wrote
              several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999).
              Among his numerous awards were two of the country’s highest
              honours, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997)
